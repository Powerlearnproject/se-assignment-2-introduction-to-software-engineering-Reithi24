Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering 
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:It is a displine that involves the application of engineering principles and practices to the design ,development,maintenance,testing and evaluation of software system.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
1. Its is used to develop simple software
2. In this methodology, testing is done once the development phase is completed
3. It follows a linear organizational expected structure.
4. It provide less security.
5. Client involvement is less as compared to Agile Development.
6. It provide less functionality in the software.
   AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
1. It is used to develop complicatated software.
2. In this methodology,testing and development processes are performed concurrently.
3. It follows an iterative organizational structure.
4. It provide high security.
5. Client involvement is high as compared to traditional software development.
6. It provides all the functionality needed by the users.
   
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):1. Gathering Requirements
                                       2. Design Stage
                                       3. Implementation Stage
                                       4. Testing Stage
                                       5. Deployment Stage
                                       6. Maintenance Stage
                                        

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1. Gathering Requirements
   It involves gathering and documenting usersneeds and systems requirements.
2. Design Stage
   Involves defings data models,systems interfaces and designing users interfaces.
3. Implementation and coding Stage
   This is the stage where developers begin building and coding the software.
4. Testing Stage
    This stage ensures the software functions correctly and meets users requirements.
5. Deployment Stage
   This is the stage when the software is released for customer to use.The users are provided with training or documentation to help them operate the software.
6. Maintenance Stage
   This is where the software is updated regularly.
   
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
   
   Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
AGILE MODEL:It is iterative and incremental,it focus on long term approach.
WATERFALL MODEL:It is Non iteractive and its best on short term approach.it follows downward.

 What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
AGILE MODEL
1. It emphasizes iterative and incremental with shorter development cycles.
2. Allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements throughout the project.
3. Priotizes customer collaboration and feedback.
4. Suited for projects where requirement may involve and where rapid delivery is valued.
   WATERFALL MODEL
1. follows a sequential,linear approach.
2. Empasizes extensive upfront planning and documentation.
3. Changes are difficult to imprelement once a phase is completed.
4. Suited for projects with well defined requirements and stable environments.
   
 in what scenarios might each be preferred?
  WATERFALL MODEL
1.The project has a fixed budget, timeline and scope.
2. Requirement well
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
What is requirements engineering?

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
